## Limitations:

Reddit API recommends that a request should be done once every second. We respect this limit therefore users with 
multiple posts/comments are fetched in batches of 100 which is the maximum that can be fetched per request.

Additionally, Reddit API returns at most the last 1000 posts and 1000 comments per user.
